The Rise of Quantum Internet Computing,"  This article highlights quantum Internet computing as referring to
distributed quantum computing over the quantum Internet, analogous to
(classical) Internet computing involving (classical) distributed computing over
the (classical) Internet. Relevant to quantum Internet computing would be areas
of study such as quantum protocols for distributed nodes using quantum
information for computations, quantum cloud computing, delegated verifiable
blind or private computing, non-local gates, and distributed quantum
applications, over Internet-scale distances.

Unconventional Quantum Computing Devices,"  This paper investigates a variety of unconventional quantum computation
devices, including fermionic quantum computers and computers that exploit
nonlinear quantum mechanics. It is shown that unconventional quantum computing
devices can in principle compute some quantities more rapidly than
`conventional' quantum computers.
"
Geometrical perspective on quantum states and quantum computation,"  We interpret quantum computing as a geometric evolution process by
reformulating finite quantum systems via Connes' noncommutative geometry. In
this formulation, quantum states are represented as noncommutative connections,
while gauge transformations on the connections play a role of unitary quantum
operations. Thereby, a geometrical model for quantum computation is presented,
which is equivalent to the quantum circuit model. This result shows a geometric
way of realizing quantum computing and as such, provides an alternative
proposal of building a quantum computer.
"
Quantum Computation and Quantum Information,"  Quantum computation and quantum information are of great current interest in
computer science, mathematics, physical sciences and engineering. They will
likely lead to a new wave of technological innovations in communication,
computation and cryptography. As the theory of quantum physics is fundamentally
stochastic, randomness and uncertainty are deeply rooted in quantum
computation, quantum simulation and quantum information. Consequently quantum
algorithms are random in nature, and quantum simulation utilizes Monte Carlo
techniques extensively. Thus statistics can play an important role in quantum
computation and quantum simulation, which in turn offer great potential to
revolutionize computational statistics. While only pseudo-random numbers can be
generated by classical computers, quantum computers are able to produce genuine
random numbers; quantum computers can exponentially or quadratically speed up
median evaluation, Monte Carlo integration and Markov chain simulation. This
paper gives a brief review on quantum computation, quantum simulation and
quantum information. We introduce the basic concepts of quantum computation and
quantum simulation and present quantum algorithms that are known to be much
faster than the available classic algorithms. We provide a statistical
framework for the analysis of quantum algorithms and quantum simulation.

"Probabilistic Process Algebra to Unifying Quantum and Classical
  Computing in Closed Systems","  We have unified quantum and classical computing in open quantum systems
called qACP which is a quantum generalization of process algebra ACP. But, an
axiomatization for quantum and classical processes with an assumption of closed
quantum systems is still missing. For closed quantum systems, unitary operator,
quantum measurement and quantum entanglement are three basic components for
quantum computing. This leads to probability unavoidable. Along the solution of
qACP to unify quantum and classical computing in open quantum systems, we unify
quantum and classical computing with an assumption of closed systems under the
framework of ACP-like probabilistic process algebra. This unification make it
can be used widely in verification for quantum and classical computing mixed
systems, such as most quantum communication protocols.

Optimal Stochastic Resource Allocation for Distributed Quantum Computing,"  With the advent of interconnected quantum computers, i.e., distributed
quantum computing (DQC), multiple quantum computers can now collaborate via
quantum networks to perform massively complex computational tasks. However, DQC
faces problems sharing quantum information because it cannot be cloned or
duplicated between quantum computers. Thanks to advanced quantum mechanics,
quantum computers can teleport quantum information across quantum networks.
However, challenges to utilizing efficiently quantum resources, e.g., quantum
computers and quantum channels, arise in DQC due to their capabilities and
properties, such as uncertain qubit fidelity and quantum channel noise. In this
paper, we propose a resource allocation scheme for DQC based on stochastic
programming to minimize the total deployment cost for quantum resources.
Essentially, the two-stage stochastic programming model is formulated to handle
the uncertainty of quantum computing demands, computing power, and fidelity in
quantum networks. The performance evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness and
ability of the proposed scheme to balance the utilization of quantum computers
and on-demand quantum computers while minimizing the overall cost of
provisioning under uncertainty.

"Review on Quantum Walk Computing: Theory, Implementation, and
  Application","  Classical random walk formalism shows a significant role across a wide range
of applications. As its quantum counterpart, the quantum walk is proposed as an
important theoretical model for quantum computing. By exploiting the quantum
effects such as superposition, interference and entanglement, quantum walks and
their variety have been extensively studied for achieving beyond classical
computing power, and they have been broadly used in designing quantum
algorithms in fields ranging from algebraic and optimization problems, graph
and network analysis, to quantum Hamiltonian and biochemical process
simulations, and even further quantum walk models have proven their
capabilities for universal quantum computation. Compared to the conventional
quantum circuit models, quantum walks show a feasible path for implementing
application-specific quantum computing in particularly the noisy
intermediate-scale quantum era. Recently remarkable progress has been achieved
in implementing a wide variety of quantum walks and quantum walk applications,
demonstrating the great potential of quantum walks. In this review, we provide
a thorough summary of quantum walks and quantum walk computing, including
aspects of quantum walk theories and characteristics, advances in their
physical implementations and the flourishingly developed quantum walk computing
applications. We also discuss the challenges facing quantum walk computing,
toward realizing a practical quantum computer in the near future.
