## Current Work
Currently, we are working on fine-tuning LLaMA, a state-of-the-art language model, to generate questions specifically related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This enhancement will enable the platform to provide a more targeted and advanced learning experience for users focusing on DSA topics.

#### The project is also part of the SRM Humanoid Project
