QuizBuddy is an innovative quiz generator platform powered by machine learning, designed to create adaptive quizzes and personalized learning experiences. The platform leverages advanced natural language processing models like T5 and GPT-Neo to deliver tailored questions based on the user's preferences and performance.

## Features
#### Adaptive Quiz Generation: Quizzes dynamically adjust based on the learner's knowledge and progress.
#### Personalized Learning: NLP models generate content tailored to individual user needs.
#### Intuitive Interface: User-friendly design ensures seamless interaction.
#### Real-Time Feedback: Immediate insights to help users learn and improve.
#### Scalability: Built to handle diverse user bases and large datasets.

## Current Work
Currently, we are working on fine-tuning LLaMA, a state-of-the-art language model, to generate questions specifically related to Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). This enhancement will enable the platform to provide a more targeted and advanced learning experience for users focusing on DSA topics.

#### The project is also part of the SRM Humanoid Project
